- Customize Morganâ€™s log format to include relevant details (e.g., `morgan(':method :url :status - :response-time ms')`).
- Combine Morgan with a logging library like Winston to implement log levels (e.g., info, warn, error) for better categorization.
- Integrate Morgan with logging services like Winston or Bunyan, streaming logs via `morgan.stream` for robust logging.
- Implement request ID tracking by adding a custom token (e.g., `morgan.token('id', req => req.id)`) for easier debugging.
- Rotate log files using a library like `rotating-file-stream` to manage log size and prevent disk space issues.

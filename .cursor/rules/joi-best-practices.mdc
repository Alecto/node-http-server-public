- Define reusable Joi schemas in a separate module (e.g., `schemas/user.js`) for common data structures to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.
- Leverage Joi's built-in validation rules (e.g., `Joi.string().min(3).required()`) for type checking and constraints.
- Implement custom validation rules using `Joi.extend()` or `custom()` when built-in rules are insufficient.
- Use Joi's `describe()` method to generate schema documentation for better maintainability and team collaboration.
